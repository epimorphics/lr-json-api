          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This is an experiment to build the 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services"
               >common RESTish web API</a> style of
            data access as is typified by Shoothill Flood data or the BBC or
            various other places and to understand the cost of production of
            such APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such APIs deliver specific information and are "self-service"
            in that the document should be all the app developer needs.
            They are a compliement to access paths to locate and extract
            large sections of the dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            This one uses the query string heavily but that's because those
            parts are not exact match. A set of URIs for each town or a postcode
            could be done in the URI-path style.
            </p>
          <p>
            It produces JSON-like JSON with JSON-LD annotations.
          </p>
          <p>It would be better to have less query string and more path
            components.  That is a limitation of the demo which uses plain
            old HTML forms.</p>
            
          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <p>
            There is a SPARQL query that gets completed, then sent to the SPARQL
            endpoint of landregistry.data.gov.uk. The results are formatted into
            JSON, fields are omitted if not found by the query.  It uses the
            text index because the SPARQL query has <tt>text:query</tt>.
            </p>
          <p>
            The results are built as a JSON object and it preserves field order,
            which is nice for developer readability having the time stamp first
            and makes the address part come out in natural order.<br>
          </p>
          <h3>API</h3>
          <p>The endpoint is</p>
    
          <pre>http://afs-1.epimorphics.com/ppd?town=...&amp;roadname=...&amp;number=...</pre>
          <p>where</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"town" can be empty - defaults to "bristol"</li>
            <li>"roadname" - required</li>
            <li>"number" - optional<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This returns JSON with a little JSON-LD sprinkled over it.  It is
            supposed to be useful as JSON and as JSON-LD/RDF.
            </p>
          <p>
            Add "<tt>&amp;inline=true</tt>" to get the JSON-LD context inline
            and not as a link.  You can post that into the JSON-LD playground
            (You can't with the @context link because CORS isn't setup). Jena
            can read the JSON-LD as RDF.</p>
          <p>
            In Jena 2.12.1, this works:

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            The target is in the first place our own production and maintenance
            of web APIs. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Write SPARQL query</li>
            <li>Write mapping to JSON(-LD)<br>
            </li>
            <li>Add @context.</li>
            <li>Documentation<br>
            </li>
            <li>Test</li>
            <li>Deploy<br>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There is very little code. Jersey does the URL parsing, the SPARQL
            query is a template, the JSON mapping is just variable to field name
            + nesting for the address.</p>
          <p>
            Even if left as code, it's very small and follows a template so
            "copy-template-project and modify" is easy to do. Modification is
            more about designing the API; the code needed is straight forward so
            I guess design time+1 day to develop and test.  There is a built-in
            test setup using grizzly.</p>
          <p>
            You do have to write the SPARQL query, or more likely, hack an
            example one.  This is not for everyone but it is for us, so that's
            easy.</p>
          <p>
            It is not crawlable. It has predictable performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is huge win for us operationally and for the customer to
            provide SLAs around services. The API is quite narrow and the SPARQL
            is not arbitrary.
